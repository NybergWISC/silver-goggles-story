A single shadow runs through the darkness created by the smoke billowing from ashes scattered everywhere in the town center.
The man stops and turns, with nowhere to hide and unable to flee any further. His eyes are bloodshot and wild, focused on something just beyond light of the nearby fire.
Ben waits for his fate as the figure with silver goggles approaches.
Ben's eye tries to make out the outline of the figure. The only think he can make out are the bright silver goggles and what appears to be an outline of a man.
With nowhere to go, Ben tries to stay as still as possible and tries his best to be silent. His whole body shivers as chills run through his body.
Ben's body tenses as he prepares for what is to come.
The man is approaching gradually and firmly, like a lion king walks to his prey. His move was slow, but Ben knows no matter how hard he tries to run, he would not 
be able to escape from his fate. Ben still got a flick knife in his pocket, but there is no way he can stand a chance in front of this guy. The only thing he is capable 
of doing is to freeze like a scared rabbit. The man is within 10 meters close, Ben's leg has started shaking.  
	Right when he thinks he's about to meet his doom, an arrow whizzes
through the air inches from Ben's face. With a dull thud, the arrow buries
itself in the figure's chest. The man shouts in agony and immediately drops
to his knees. Head whipping from side to side, Ben can't seem to locate the
source of his saving arrow -- he thought he was the only person left in the city.
As the man's life dwindles in front of Ben, all he can do is thank whatever god
might still be looking out for him and continue on his journey.
